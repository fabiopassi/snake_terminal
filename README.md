# snake_terminal

Snake game for LINUX terminal.

The game is written in C (no fancy packages required).

To compile the code in LINUX (only gcc is required), move in the directory contaning the `makefile` and simply type:

```bash
make
```

Then, move in the ./build directory and type:

```bash
./exe
```

to play the game.

DISCLAIMER: This procedure was tested only on ubuntu 22.04, but it should work also on other distros. It will likely **not** work in Windows.
